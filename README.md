# Car Management

Web3 application for tracking the history of cars whose data is saved on the blockchain. The backend of the application was created in the Express.js framework, Solidity and the database used was the MongoDB database and the blockchain itself. For the blockchain, I used the Volta testnet. The JavaScript EJS framework was used for the frontend of the application. Other details are explained in the documentation written in Croatian.
